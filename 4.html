      <h2>nomcore</h2>
      <p>Normcore is one of those ambiguous 21st-century terms that was bandied around a lot for a number of years while rarely being truly defined.<br>
        So what is normcore, exactly? <br>
        How do you know if something is normcore or not? Does it still exist and do we even want it to?<br></p>
      <p>Normcore is about authenticity.<br> It’s a rejection of extravagance. <br>It's about subverting any notion of edginess.<br>
         It's about dressing like Jerry Seinfeld. <br>It was a fashion trend but was also derided enough to become a meme.</p>
      <h2>street</h2>
      <p>Street fashion is fashion that is considered to have emerged not from studios, but from the grassroots streetwear.<br>
        Street fashion is generally associated with youth culture, and is most often seen in major urban centers.<br>
        Magazines and Newspapers like the New York Times and Elle commonly feature candid photographs of individuals wearing urban, stylish clothing.<br>
        Japanese street fashion sustains multiple simultaneous highly diverse fashion movements at any given time.<br>
        Mainstream fashion often appropriates street fashion trends as influences.<br>
        Nowadays, street fashion is getting more and more popular. Most major youth subcultures have had an associated street fashion.<br>
        Streetstyle is different all around the globe.<br>
